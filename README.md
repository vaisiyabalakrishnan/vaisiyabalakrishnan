# 👋 Welcome
Hi, I'm Vaisiya, a Data Science & AI undergraduate at NTU and a Turing AI Scholar. I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My current research explores the frontiers of agentic AI, program synthesis, and large language models (LLMs).

## 🔬 Team Research Projects
- AI-Mediated Pair Programming for Algorithm Learning: Designing a role-constrained AI coding assistant to support DSA learning.
- Program Synthesis of Underspecified Human-Robot Interaction: Investigating intent inference and multi-turn clarification dialogues in HRI.
- [Goalie](https://github.com/t-xueen/alfworld_project): Guiding Embodied Agents with Subgoal-Driven Prompts: A prompt-only framework for embodied LLM agents that achieved 86.67% success on ALFWorld benchmarks.

## 🚀 Team Hackathon Projects
- [Sandbagging Detection via Consistency Probing](https://github.com/atharshlakshmi/SandbagDetect): A framework to detect LLM sandbagging by comparing performance on evaluation-framed vs. casual-framed prompts.
- [Common Ground - Interactive Visual Novel](https://github.com/klk645445/SignLanguageVisualNovel): An AI-powered visual novel for deaf etiquette education (2nd Place, NTU TAISP Hackathon).
- [ValidO - Review Quality Classifier](https://github.com/atharshlakshmi/validO): A ML pipeline to classify low-quality Google Local reviews.
